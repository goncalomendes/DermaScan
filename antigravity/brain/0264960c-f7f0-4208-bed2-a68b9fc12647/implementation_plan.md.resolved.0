# Implementation Plan - DermaScan Initialization

## Goal Description
Initialize the DermaScan project by verifying the existing backend and AI service skeletons and setting up the mobile application structure.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- Verify `pom.xml` dependencies.
- Ensure `DermaScanApplication.java` is correctly configured.
- Check `application.properties` for database configuration.

### AI Service (Python)
- Verify `requirements.txt`.
- Ensure `main.py` has a basic API endpoint (likely Flask or FastAPI).

### Mobile App
- Initialize a new mobile project.
    - **Decision Point**: React Native or Flutter? (Will assume React Native given the web app context in system prompt, but will check user preference if not clear. Defaulting to React Native/Expo for rapid prototyping if not specified).
    - *Update*: User mentioned "Cross-platform mobile application". I will propose React Native with Expo.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `mvn test` for Backend.
- Run `pytest` (if available) or check importability for AI Service.
- Run `npm start` for Mobile App to verify build.

### Manual Verification
- Start Backend server and hit health endpoint.
- Start AI Service and hit health endpoint.
- Launch Mobile App in simulator/emulator.
